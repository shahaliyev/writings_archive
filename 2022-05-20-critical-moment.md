Let me narrate the most critical moment of [Nakhchivan Open 2022](/posts/nakhchivan-open) tournament. It's going to be a fine read.

I was ranked fifth in the [starting list](https://chess-results.com/tnr626639.aspx?lan=1&art=0&turdet=YES&flag=30), immediately after four grandmasters. I was also confident in my abilities and half-jokingly, half-seriously, would tell my coach about my plans of finishing the tournament with +9 (9 wins, 0 draws, 0 losses). And, indeed, after beating the Iranian grandmaster on round 7, I was getting very close to my goal.

The game 8 also started well. With black pieces I got a promising position from the opening and took an extra pawn in the middlegame. However, my opponent, another grandmaster, had enough compensation for the pawn, and all three results seemed to be equally possible on the horizon. At this point, probably not very much liking his position, my opponent offered me a draw.

Before round 8, he was the only player with 6.5 points, half a point trailing me. It meant that draw was a fully acceptable outcome, keeping me the leader for the last round, when I'd face a relatively weaker opponent with white pieces. But it also meant that the victory would make me the champion one round prior to the finish line, with a certain demonstration of power.

My immediate instinct was to reject the draw offer. A reason for that was that I always arrived at the tournament hall with hatred toward my opponent (after the game, luckily, unaffected by the result, my hatred instantly disappears). But a deeper reason to continue the game was my desire to ace the tournament with 9 wins out of 9 games, as I "promised" so.

However, the more I dived into the position on the board, the less optimistic I got about the evaluation. But my desire to win all the games in the tournament was affecting my decision-making. I was paralyzed. After lurking in confusion for several minutes, I finally realized two things:

1) My irrational desires, concerning solely my self-esteem or vanity, should not interfere with my current decisions. Or as a rarely known rule speaks: "it doesn't matter which pieces are gone off the board, what matters is which pieces are left."

2) The main aim in any competition is "to win the competition", and including any other criterion to this aim (such as "to win all the games in the competition") can only be detrimental to the performance.

When I left the hall, I naturally got ridiculed for my earlier ambition. But as accepting the draw was my deliberate decision, this ridicule didn't affect me.

The next day, I won the game with not much fuss and became the champion.

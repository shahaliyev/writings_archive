## Go (GoLang)

Go is an open-source multi-paradigm programming language that looks like C, but is not a full copycat of C. It approaches data abstraction and object-oriented paradigm in a flexible manner while having garbage collection and automatic memory management in its arsenal. Go is statically typed and is faster than dynamic languages, as it had a goal of replacing them.

### Go is not Go!

Go (due to its [web-domain](https://golang.org/), also referred to as Golang) is not the same as [Go!](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/annals.pdf) programming language designed by Francis McCabe and Keith Clark. The development of Go was started at Google in 2007, as Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson all had a dislike for C++ (correlation, not causation).

### Go Origins

In addition to C, from which Go takes its main features, Go was also highly influenced by, so-called [_Niklaus Wirth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth) languages, starting with _Pascal (mainly the package concept, package syntax, etc)._ The final branch of Go’s origins comes from the little-known languages developed at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs), integrating the concept of _CSP_ ([_Communicating Sequential Processes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20communicating%20sequential,on%20message%20passing%20via%20channels.)).

### Core Values of Go

__Simplicity.__ The main reason why Go emerged was due to the complexity problem in other languages. When you fix an issue in one area, its complexity increases, and as a consequence, other areas get complicated as well. For this reason, Go manifests itself with a simple design.

__Maintenance.__ This is correlated with simplicity. The simpler the software is, the easier it is to maintain it over an extended period of time.

__Locality.__ Go’s data types and most libraries work with no initialization or constructors, whereas its aggregate types require less storage.

__Safety.__ Memory safety be it (see references).

## Dart

Dart is a pure object-oriented language, coming from the Algol family’s C branch (see the image above). Characteristics of these family members (including Go) are the following:

*   functions and subroutines
*   value and reference-based parameters
*   procedural and imperative emphasis
*   code blocks (if, while, etc)

Dart is also class-based, optionally typed, and supports [mixin-based inheritance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53699482/what-is-mixin-based-inheritance-in-dart) and [actor-style concurrency](https://berb.github.io/diploma-thesis/original/054_actors.html) (I don’t know what the hell they are). Optionally typed means that the types in Dart are syntactically optional and they have no effect on runtime semantics, which means if you wish, you may leave out defining types — the compiler will not reject your program.

There is nothing innovative in Dart. Lars Bak and Kasper Lund, the developers of the language had the main goal of creating an efficient platform for writing web-applications. A useful feature of Dart is that you can compile it to JavaScript and run it on any browser.

## Prolog

Forget about everything that you have been taught as a programmer. Take a deep breath. Whatever you are going to read soon is nothing but familiar. Beware of your clicks. As you may find yourself forever lost in the underworld of logic programming languages.

## All You Need is Logic Programming Languages

Before getting into details, here is a quick shpargalka for the logic programming paradigm:

*   **Logic programs are declarative.** You probably are familiar with procedural languages with all the assignments and stuff (more about that later). By contrast, _in logic programming languages, the specifications are declared, not assigned_. You should know that both declarative programming and logic programming refer to the same concept.
*   **Logic programming languages consist of facts and rules.**
*   **Logic programming relies on predicate calculus.**
*   **Prolog is the most widely used logic programming language.**
*   As declarative language semantics is much simpler than the semantics of imperative languages (i.e. most of the currently popular programming languages), _language semantics is considered to be an advantage of logic programming over imperative programming._

## Procedural vs Nonprocedural Programming

Imperative and functional programming languages can be considered as being **procedural**, that is, a programmer instructs the computer on exactly how a result should be computed. On the other foot, the logic programming paradigm is **nonprocedural**. This means that programs do not state exactly how the computation is to be done, but describe the form of the result.

## Can’t Buy Me Prolog

As Prolog is the most widely used logic programming language, we are willing to discuss it. There are different dialects of Prolog — Marseille group, Edinburgh group, and the group developed for microcomputers. We will discuss **Edinburgh syntax** as the [**Concepts of Programming Languages**](http://Concepts%20of%20Programming%20Languages) book (see the end of the article) discusses it. More specifically, my personal taste will lean on [**SWI-Prolog**](https://www.swi-prolog.org/), which is very simple and tidy.

## Here Comes the Prolog

Prolog statements and data are constructed from **terms**, which are either a constant, variable, or structure.

A **constant** could be an atom or an integer. An atom, being similar to its [Lisp](https://shahaliyev.medium.com/lisp-is-beyond-good-and-evil-336f6bb763f0) counterpart, is either a string of letters, digits, and underscores beginning with a _lowercase_ letter or a string of any printable.

A **variable** differs from a constant by being written beginning with an _uppercase letter_. The binding of a type to a variable is called an **instantiation,** which occurs in the [**resolution**](http://athena.ecs.csus.edu/~mei/logicp/unification-resolution.html#:~:text=Resolution%20is%20a%20technique%20of,true%20if%20p%20is%20true.) process.

Finally, we have a **structure**, identified by the functor:

```prolog
functor(parameter list)
```

## **Fact statements**

Facts can mean whatever the programmer wants them to mean. For example, “car” could be the speed in miles per seconds written in morse alphabet, and “500" could mean a roast chicken.

```prolog
speed(car, 500)
```

## Rule statements

If -> then. It should be clear I guess. Commas could be considered as logical AND operators. In general form, rules can be written as follows:

```prolog
consequence :- antecedent_expression.
```

## Goal statements

Goals (or queries) are, simply put, theorems that the system either proves or disproves by responding yes or no.

```prolog
chicken(roasted)
```

Goals are syntactically very similar to facts, so the only way they are distinguished is dependent on which mode they are written in. For example, the online [SWI-Prolog compiler](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/) has two separate windows — one for declaring rules and facts, and the other for queries (goals).

## List Structures

In addition to atomic propositions, there is another basic data structure called **list**. We create a list as follows:

```prolog
new_list([argon, jargon, gorgon])
```

If we are going to bring an analog with [**Lisp**](/posts/lisp), CAR and CDR of a list can be denoted with the following expression:

```prolog
new_list([Head | Tail])
```

That will make Head instantiated as `[argon]`, and Tail as `[jargon, gorgon]`.

Another similarity of Prolog to Lisp is append, which differs a little in its implementation. I will refer to the [SWI-Prolog documentation](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=lists), partly because I am lazy and partly because I don’t want to reinvent the bicycle.

## Prolog Resolution

Goals can be compound, when each of their facts is called a subgoal. There are two approaches to match a goal to a fact in the database.

**Bottom-up resolution** or **forward chaining** is when we start with the facts and rules in the database and search for a sequence of matches that will lead to the goal.

**Top-down resolution** or **backward** **chaining** is when we start with the goal and search for a sequence of matches that will lead to some set of facts in the database. It works well when there is a small number of candidate answers, otherwise, forward chaining is preferable.

Prolog designers have decided to implement **backward chaining for resolution** instead of forward chaining.

When a goal has more than one structure, Prolog needs to choose between **depth-first** and **breadth-first** search. Depth-first search finds a complete sequence of propositions of a subgoal before working on others, whereas breadth-first search works on all subgoals in parallel.

Prolog designers have decided to implement **depth-first search** instead of breadth-first, as the latter requires a large amount of memory.

**Back-tracking.** When the system fails to prove a subgoal, it abandons the subgoal. Then the system goes on to reconsider the previous subgoal and find an alternative solution for it. Such reconsideration is called [back-tracking](https://www.javatpoint.com/backtracking-in-prolog).

## Prolog Arithmetic

Prolog can work with integer variables and integer arithmetic. Originally, operators were only functors, but now Prolog supports the following expression:

```prolog
A is B + C
```

When B and C (right-side) **must** already be instantiated when A (left-side) **must not**. It is not an assignment statement that we use in imperative programming. Not meeting one of the “must” conditions will result in the failure of the clause.

## Prolog Example

For a better understanding of the logic that we have been discussing all along, let’s take the simplified example below which I took from the CPL book (see the reference):

```prolog
distance(X, Y) :- speed(X, Speed), time(X, Time),  
Y is Speed * Time.
```

The expression above calculates the distance of an instantiated atom. For example, after declaring both speed and time

```prolog
speed(car, 50).  
time(car, 10).
```

we can query to retrieve the distance.

```prolog
distance(car, Cardist).
```

Do not mess up with the Capital letters. You can copy-paste the code and try it on the [SWI-Prolog console](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/).

## Tracing Model

A built-in structure of Prolog called **trace** displays the instantiations of values to variables at each step. It is a [debugging mechanism of Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=debugger) programs.

The **tracing model** describes Prolog execution in four steps.

1.  Call
2.  Exit
3.  Redo
4.  Fail

**Call** happens in the beginning when we try to satisfy a goal, **exit** happens when the goal actually gets satisfied, **redo** happens during back-tracking, **fail** happens when the system cannot prove the query.

## Resolution Order Control

As Prolog always matches in the same order, from the beginning of the database to the end, the user can increase the efficiency of a program by placing some rules to the beginning of the database. Prolog also allows some explicit control of backtracking with the help of the **cut (!)** operator.

```prolog
a, b, !, c.
```

Here, if c fails, the whole goal fails, as the programmer assumes that whenever c fails, there is no need to resatisfy a or b.

Although the cut operator is important, it is possible to abuse it by making logic programs have a control flow similar to imperative programming styles. Of course, it undermines the importance of logic programming, as now we specify how solutions are to be found. That reduces the readability and writability of programs.

We have already noted that **the semantics of logic programming languages is their main advantage over their imperative counterparts**. However, trying to make use of resolution order control by increasing efficiency, one can clutter the code with all the unnecessary details of how the solutions are to be determined.

## Limitations of Prolog

We have just discussed one limitation of Prolog. However, there are some more. So may I have your attention, please.

**Closed-Word Assumption.** Prolog’s world is so narrow; its knowledge is only bound within its database. If the database doesn’t have any information to prove the received query absolutely, then the system returns false. **Prolog can prove that something is true, but it can’t prove if it is false**. Innocent until proven guilty. But it is false logic: if a query isn’t absolutely true, then it isn’t necessarily false.

Another important limitation of Prolog, the [**Negation Problem**](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/negation.html), arises as a consequence of the closed-word assumption.

Again, as opposed to procedural programming, programmers specify what a program is supposed to do without a need for specifying how exactly. But that leads to some intrinsic limitations of Prolog.

For example, it is impossible to transform the description of a sorted list into some efficient algorithm for sorting. Even resolution is not capable of fixing that. Therefore, there is no way but to specify the details of how efficient sorting can be done, which unfortunately morphs the pure logic paradigm of Prolog into imperative or functional one.

## Application of Logic Programming

Enough about Prolog. In [**Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS) queries are often written in Structured Query Language (SQL) which is nonprocedural. A user doesn’t need to specify how to retrieve data. In addition to RDBMS, logic programming is also frequently used in [**Expert Systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system#:~:text=In%20artificial%20intelligence%2C%20an%20expert,than%20through%20conventional%20procedural%20code.) and [**Natural-Language Processing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).

## Epilog

No, I am not a Beatle fan. Referencing doesn’t imply admiring. Except for the case below, of course.

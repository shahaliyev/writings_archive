**TLDR:** 1) I don't get paid for writing this short promotional article, 2) [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) is an open-source front-end for using Youtube (and a couple of other apps) on Android without ads and more importantly -- without YouTube Shorts.

**BACKGROUND:** Since the end of 2022 I deleted my remaining social media accounts (Linkedin + Facebook). However, there (are) were websites that still drained my time. Youtube was the major issue because of its addictive and irritating Shorts feature.

Initially, I was tackling this "shorts problem" with my willpower by asking myself a simple queston: 'Do I need to watch this?' The answer was almost always 'no' and that was keeping me from wasting my time. But every now and then, when I was tired, I'd get into the endless loop of Youtube shorts, only to get disgusted by my behavior eventually.

Searched Youtube videos are useful, but the accidental, random, unnecessary Youtube shorts are useless and not only -- they are harmful. They waste your time and make you stupid. There is no option to switch shorts off in the Youtube App, but it turns out there is even a better solution which was advised by a friend of mine. I was so overjoyed about the news that I decided to write this ad for Newpipe.

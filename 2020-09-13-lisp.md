> **Update:** In chess, your upbringing is questioned if you have never studied classical games. Knowing those games, despite them being played at a lower quality than today’s standards, is still crucial for a chess player’s development.
Seems like, the same analogy will soon be applied to Lisp. Unless a new kind of hardware emerges, Lisp’s future will be bounded within academic realms (although, even that is under question; MIT has switched to teaching Python instead of Scheme). You should learn Lisp sooner or later to become a well-rounded programmer, to have a “good upbringing”, but what is the use of having a good upbringing if you are dependent on learning what the market demands? The market doesn’t look for mastery, it looks for profit.

I had three reasons to write about Lisp: 1) I accidentally clicked on the hyperlink that led to the chapter 15 of our Software Paradigms course textbook, 2) Lisp was our eccentric freshman year professor, the one and only Dr. Gladkikh‘s favorite programming language, and 3) I had almost read every single essay by Paul Graham, except for ones that were related to Lisp.

Those who need a well-written introduction to Lisp, should refer to the aforementioned [blog](http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html). Here, you will only find a couple of flashy highlights about the language itself, as this article is meant to entertain and not to teach (both of which I can’t do). If you have any doubts regarding the credibility of the reading that follows, even if your doubt is microscopic, just be sure: I have zero experience in Lisp.

## Functional and Imperative Programming Languages

Although not purely, Lisp is a functional programming language — and functional languages, strangely enough, are based on [mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20function%20is,real%20numbers%20to%20real%20numbers.). Unlike imperative languages (such as everything) that highly rely on von Neumann Architecture, Lisp tries not to restrict itself to anything. [^1]

**Imperative programming languages** (abbreviated as _IL_ from now on) have state (variables, memory cells) that change over time, and this makes it difficult for a human to guess the outcome of a program.

**Functional programming languages** (_FL_) have no state, hence, iteration becomes obsolete. Instead of loops, FL rely on recursion. Unlike IL, here, if given the same parameters, executed functions always return the same outcome. That eases testing and readability. [^2]

The syntax and semantics of FL are simpler than of IL’s, and even though functional programs tend to be relatively slower than their imperative counterparts, they are still considered to be efficient enough.

## Why Lisp is Awful

As you probably are here out of Lisp-curiosity or via Skype link, I am not going to bring arguments for you to learn Lisp. But I can suggest you a trick if you want to understand whether a programming language is worth studying or not.

Instead of googling _why learn X_, or _why X is good,_ you must type _why NOT learn X_, or _why X is bad._ That always gives you a better impression of the language (or product, company, etc).

Unlike other programming languages (such as Python), I couldn’t find any strict critique or a huge shortcoming of Lisp. The main disadvantage seems to be that Lisp lacks extensive libraries.

You will find links below questioning this issue, but my overall impression was that Lisp is not an awful language (ahem), it is just suited for enlightened programmers — which I am not, neither you are.

## Detailed History of Lisp

Lisp was the first FL eva, developed by [John McCarthy](http://jmc.stanford.edu/index.html) at MIT in 1959. [^3]

## Lisp Programming

Lisp, despite being completely FL during its creation, later integrated some of the imperative programming features as well. Many dialects of Lisp have been written since, _Scheme_ being the simplest one to grasp the fundamentals of FL.

Lisp highly relies on lists (LISP = LISt Processing). If you want to see what Lisp is famous for, take a look at two symbols below:

> ( )

This is called S-expression, standing for symbolic expression. If you are going to type your Lisp code on a simple text editor, make sure that your keyboard’s _Shift_ button works well.

## Lisp Code

I can give a quick impression of how a Lisp code looks like with the following line, written in Scheme. It is a function for finding the cube of x.

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
```

Pay attention that the multiplication operator is written before atoms. The next line of code will display the cube of 5.

```scheme
(display (cube 5))
```

Note that, _input_ and _output_ are not a part of a purely functional language, as they change the state of a program.

## Which Lisp Dialect to Learn

_Scheme_ is the cleanest, _Common Lisp_ is the most pragmatic and ugly, _Clojure_ is for Java lovers, _Hy_ is for Python lovers. Forget about everything else (\*gets sued by other dialect developers\*). I would certainly start with _Scheme_. The following links are meant to create a better view of Lisp dialects, which I won’t include in the references section:

*   [Which dialect of Lisp should I learn?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1007250/which-dialect-of-lisp-should-i-learn)
*   [Scheme vs Common Lisp](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5368090/what-are-the-actual-differences-between-scheme-and-common-lisp-or-any-other-tw)
*   [Which dialect is most used?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/55284/is-lisp-still-useful-in-todays-world-which-version-is-most-used#:~:text=Yes%2C%20it%20is%2C%20but%20you,with%20small%20companies%20in%20Europe.) (read the second answer, because: apples)

## Books to Read

Almost in every forum and article discussing Lisp, I got a reference for two books: [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (a supernatural book, usually abbreviated as SICP), and [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition). It doesn’t mean that the books are great, but they scream for attention.

## References and Further Reading

*   [**Lisp FAQ**](http://www.paulgraham.com/lispfaq1.html)**.** The best short article that introduces you to Lisp.
*   [**How Lisp Became God’s Own Programming Language**](https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html)**.** A well-researched and well-written blog post by 0b10, concerning the history of Lisp. It is an excellent article for an initial pump. And drama, and so on.
*   [**Concepts of Programming Languages**](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Sebesta-Pearson-e-Text-for-Concepts-of-Programming-Languages-Access-Code-Card-12th-Edition/PGM2043606.html) (12th ed.) by _Robert W. Sebesta._ Our textbook. Chapter 15 is about functional programming languages, and the section above, explaining the differences between FL and IL mainly comes from there.
*   [**History of Lisp**](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/lisp/lisp.pdf) _by John McCarthy_**.** This is a Lisp classic. John McCarthy talks about the early developments of Lisp, and how it came to be that Lisp emerged. Didn’t read it though.
*   [**What is wrong with Lisp?**](http://www.metamodular.com/Essays/wrong.text) An article that “defends” Lisp. All I understood from reading it was that Lisp is not bad, and popularity doesn’t imply greatness. Plus, the article seemed to be largely inspired by a Paul Graham essay called [**If Lisp is So Great**](http://www.paulgraham.com/iflisp.html), which is a better and concise reading.
*   [**The Evolution of Lisp**](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/HOPL2-Uncut.pdf)**.** The authors (_Guy Steele, Richard Gabriel_) are two of the many developers of _Common Lisp_. Steele also developed _Scheme_. I just quickly skimmed (schemed?) through the paper, and it looked like a decent one (duh).
*   [**The Nature of Lisp**](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html)**.** I couldn't read this one till the end, as it had enough technical details that I didn’t want to bother with. However, it is an exceptionally good article, describing the author’s experience of learning Lisp (though it is an overly-simplistic description).
*   Two more articles, describing the advantages and disadvantages of Lisp, poked with philosophical jokes and some technical details are the twin essays called [**Why We Love Lisp**](https://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWeLoveLisp) and [**Why We Hate Lisp**](https://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWeHateLisp). Just like the previous article, you need to possess certain technical knowledge to fully appreciate the readings. I didn’t appreciate the readings.
*   And the final article is again written by Paul Graham, called [**Beating the Averages**](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html). You must read the essay if you want to force yourself into liking Lisp.

## Footnotes

[^1]: How about trivia: **John von Neumann** (pronounced as “fohn Noymən”), despite his Germanized name, was born in Budapest. _Neumann János Lajos_ was his real name, which now sounds exceptionally Hungarian, and he was able to divide 8-digit numbers in his head when he was 6 years old. A typical child prodigy. Von Neumann belonged to the group of elite Hungarian scientists (some years later!), known as [_The Martians_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_%28scientists%29), who emigrated to the United States in the early twentieth century. In Princeton, for example, he’d regularly blast out German march music on his phonograph, thus annoying everyone, including Albert Onestone.

[^2]: NASA would also rely on Lisp. If the story goes correctly, [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/how-we-saved-the-deep-space-1-spacecraft/)’s _Deep Space 1_ mission in 1998 encountered a subtle bug, which was detected only in space. The team was able to track down the race condition on time, fix the running code, and successfully conclude the experiments. Lisp fans will say that it was because of Lisp’s high readability. I will say that it was because the team members were smart. Probably both.

[^3]: I’d rather write one well-researched and extremely detailed article, but as I tend to jump from one interest to another, I will try to complete the first draft of this essay as soon as possible. My curiosity already demands from me to read the 100 pages long research paper dedicated to the evolution of Lisp, which I will surely read (no) if I am ever going to have a passion to write another article about Lisp.

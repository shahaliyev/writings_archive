Social media should only be used for careful reporting, for building a personal brand, for creating a positive public mask. And everything valuable and personal should be kept away from it. It took so long for me to realize such a simple heuristic.

Let's say my friend narrates me his innermost feelings, his relationships with others, his happiness or sadness. As a result, I feel connected and valued. A day passes. Whilst scrolling my social media feed, I notice that my friend has published a post about what he had discussed with me. It is a personal and well-written post which gets the attention of the public &ndash; he is praised by others in the form of likes and comments and is happier for the next 24 hours. But something else has changed: as a consequence of the post, I no longer feel special. Why? Because happiness has been prostituted. 
 
Another issue emerges when a post declaring vulnerable feelings doesn't get enough attention (expected likes) on social media. As happiness of the current event has shifted to the happiness of possible approval of others for that event, that is, if the source of happiness has shifted from our inner self to the outer world, even if partially, then how can one learn to fully appreciate the good fortune he posesses? No longer he is happy solely because of a happy moment, and now his happiness may have stains because of people who he barely knows. It is akin to telling embarassing stories to a person who doesn't value us. That person won't appreciate your vulnerability, and your stories and feelings will lose in value.

Let's abruptly finish this short writing by modifying the quote at the top: _Happiness is real when shared with people whom we value._

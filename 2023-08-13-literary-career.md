My main objective for the next twelve months is starting my literary career. The cause for it is Andre Maurois' novella called [История одной карьеры](https://lublulitru.my1.ru/load/andre_morua/istorija_odnoj_karery/istorija_odnoj_karery/46-1-0-52) (ru. History of a Career), which I read five months ago, in March 2023, out of boredom when I was ill. Until that watershed moment, I would feel total lack of confidence in my life experience, and hence, in my ability to write something meaningful. "One should get published after he is forty, when he has gained enough understanding of people and life." &ndash; I would tell myself (after hearing a similar argument by [Lee Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8slg78LVPQ)). Maurois opened my eyes. I asked for the opinions of others, more experienced people, and they simply pointed out that most of the writers started their careers early on. Rarely they created their masterpieces immediately (they were not musicians or artists), but long career helped them to hone their skills over the years in order to write something worthwhile.[^1] 

What I now think is that, when writing, a young person should look within ("Qəlbimdən gələn səs mənə çox zadlar öyrədir." &ndash; Socrates), and not be anxious about lacking experience in life. The experience will arrive naturally, at its own pace, and all that is demanded from him right now is just to not shut himself to the outside world and appreciate opportunities as they come. Erudition (self-education) should happen parallelly, but one mustn't prefer reading books to taking action.[^2] I realized it more clearly upon reading a [marginalian article](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/07/30/henry-miller-the-books-in-my-life/) on Henry Miller about books:

> "One thing is certain today — the illiterate are definitely not the least intelligent among us. If it be knowledge or wisdom one is seeking, then one had better go direct to the source. And the source is not the scholar or philosopher, not the master, saint, or teacher, but life itself — direct experience of life."

Napoleon devoured the essential literature before he was even twenty, and returned back to reading Plutarch once more only when he was exiled to the island of St. Helena. Perhaps, boredom was his main cause for reading. Napoleon was a man of experience and understood human characters well; what taught him such skills? Not books, for sure.

Experience is important. It is also necessary for a person to obtain fundamental tools before commiting to an action (e.g. writing a book). What is clear to me, for example, is that I don't even have the necessary erudition of a twenty-year-old Napoleon. That erudition starts with the [latin and classical literature](/posts/stendhal). Understanding that there is no end to studying classics, I decided to come up with a minimal list, partially inspired by the so-called [Brodsky List](https://www.openculture.com/2013/11/joseph-brodskys-reading-list-for-having-an-intelligent-conversation.html) and Maurois' advice on self-education in his writing called [An Open Letter to a Young Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847902-an-open-letter-to-a-young-man). 

The rule to the list is simple: **I mustn't add anything to the list. I must read each day in an habitual basis.** Absolutely nothing should be added, as reading builds literary greed, and one says to himself: "Just one more book, one last book, this time, and then I will begin writing."

The issue I face currently is not common one. _If I am to start my literary career, in what language should I write?_ A ridiculous question that may sound, but it is not. All the essential literature I need to read is difficult to find with a proper translation in Azerbaijani language. So what I read, unless it is an English-language writer, I read in Russian. Shakespeare and Tolstoy I read in their original languages respectively, but the ancient Greek/Latin, as well as, French literature I prefer reading in Russian translation.

Writing in English language would allow me to expose my writing to a larger (global) audience. But my goal is not to commercialize my books and make money out of them. And as I have a poor literary education in English, it will take more time for me to master the language. So the English language option falls off.

Out of the remaining two &ndash; my native Azerbaijani language and Russian language &ndash; I would have made my obvious choice without further thought, if not two theoretical considerations.

Firstly, as I said, my preference of reading translated literature is in Russian language due to its quality. That means, just like in English language, I have never trained my literary skills in Azerbaijani. Secondly, and it hurts me to admit it, Azerbaijani language has been [hindered in its development](/posts/orwell-1984) because of the Russian occupation. As a consequence, it struggles with its (political) vocabulary, as well as with the shades and efficiency of its words, whereas the Russian language has access to many subtle differences in meaning.[^3]

For example, there is no easy translation of the word _честолюбие_ even to english. It is translated as _ambition_ as far as I know, when the synonym/analogue _амбиция_ has a subtle shade in Russian languge. Yet let's try to translate the word _честолюбие_ into Azerbaijani. Isn't it _şöhrətpərəstlik_, as noted in [online vocabularies](https://obastan.com/%D0%A7%D0%95%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%9E%D0%9B%D0%AE%D0%91%D0%98%D0%95/874951/?l=az)? But then тщеславие (vanity) is [also](https://obastan.com/%D1%82%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B5/99852/?l=az) _şöhrətpərəstlik._

I opened up Stendhal's _The Red and Black_ in three different languages &ndash; in Azerbaijani, Russian, and English. Following is the translation of two important nouns to describe the commonly encountered traits of human character.

> vanity, тщеславие, şöhrətpərəstlik
{: .prompt-info}

> ambition, честолюбие, izzəti-nəfs 
{: .prompt-danger}

Quite a realization! I searched it in [vocabulary](https://obastan.com/izz%C9%99ti-n%C9%99fs/20228/): the arabic word _izzəti-nəfs_ has a closer meaning to the word _dignity_ than to _ambition_. Perhaps, the translator was in a rush, and translated the word _честолюбие_ literally &ndash; as _love of honor (izzəti-nəfs)_ by considering the combination of both words: _честь (honor)_ and _любовь (love)_. From here, I also arrive at another ridiculous conclusion: the word _ambition_ in French is... _ambition_! Hence the translation wasn't even directly from the original language of the book. Would the translation happen from the French language, there would be no confusion about the tricky word of _честолюбие_. That is the work of _[Qanun Nəşriyyat](https://www.qanun.az/qirmizi-ve-qara-stendal-752#)_, a popular and well-respected publication house in Azerbaijan.[^4] After this, how am I to rely on translations in my native language?

Well, I still don't know if there is a translation of the word _ambition_ into Azerbaijani or not. For now, we will borrow it from its latin origin: _ambisiya_. Ugly.

So in what language to write? I know that my language is richer than I assume it to be, and if it is not, then by my duty I should enrich it. But to start such a journey, I must educate myself in the second front &ndash; in Azerbaijani front, studying the literary classics of my homeland. I should notice its Turkic, Arabic, and Persian influences, I should explore how my language evolved over the past few centuries. Reading the essential Azerbaijani literature should also explain me the character and identity of Azerbaijani nation, my nation.[^5] Reading Balzac won't tell me the morals and inclinations of Azerbaijanis, reading Shikhli will do.

The following list is not comprehensive, and unlike the general reading list above, it can be modified and improved.

## Literature in Azerbaijani

- [ ] Cəlil Məmmədquluzadə: Seçilmiş Əsərləri / Ölülər
- [ ] Əbdürrəhim bəy Haqverdiyev: Seçilmiş Əsərləri / Xortdanın Cəhənnəm Məktubları 
- [ ] Mirzə Fətəli Axundzadə: Seçilmiş Əsərləri
- [ ] İsmayıl Şıxlı: Dəli Kür
- [ ] Hüseyn Cavid: İblis
- [ ] Məmməd Səid Ordubadi: Qılınc və Qələm
- [ ] Mir Cəlal Paşayev: Bir Gəncin Manifesti
- [ ] İlyas Əfəndiyev: Geriyə Baxma, Qoca
- [ ] Cəfər Cabbarlı: Oqtay Eloğlu
- [ ] Elçin: Mahmud və Məryəm
- [ ] Kitabi-Dədə Qorqud

It's been a while that I dream of launching an analogue to the [Gutenberg Project](https://gutenberg.org/) for Azerbaijani literature &ndash; to create a digitalized and free online resource solely consisting of the works by the classics of Azerbaijani literature. My other dream &ndash; the translation of essential world literature into Azerbaijani by volunteers, and making the material publicly available via the same online portal seems unrealistic. It is easier to teach my compatriots English language and show them Gutenberg, than find many skilled and responsible volunteer translators into Azerbaijani language. Even though I am being pessimistic, online resources with translations in both directions (Azerbaijani to English, Foreign to Azerbaijani) have already been initiated by [Azerbaijan International](http://azeri.org/Azeri/az_latin/latin_lit/literature_home_index.html). Another example is [Kitabı Karandaşla Oxuyanlar](http://www.kkoworld.com/%c9%99l-isi/) (these are what I am aware of). Yet their praiseworthy work seems minimal and not continious.[^6]

We are almost done. Once the minimal education of Azerbaijani literature is concluded, very little is remaining. Parallelly, I should study Azerbaijani history and politics of the past century, understand our cultural identity. I must study my notable compatriots, ancestors, as well as understand political structure and history of the Soviets and Russia, Ottoman Empire and Turkey, Iran, and Transcaucasia in general.  

After I complete my education, I promise, I promise that I will finally start my literary career.

## Appendix: Bizim "Obrazovannı"lar

<div lang="az">
Mənim bir rəfiqim var, özü də müsəlmandır. Amma məni görəndə rus dilindən savayı özgə dildə danışmaz. Məsələn, söhbətimiz bu cür olur: mən onu görəndə deyirəm: "Hardan gəlirsən?" 

O mənə belə cavab verir: "Ya xodil na poçtu." 

Deyirəm: "Dünən niyə bizə gəlmədin?" 

Cavab verir: "K nam prişli qosti". 

Deyirəm: "Yaxşı, qonaqlar gedəndən sonra gələydin!" 

Cavab verir: "Net, uje bılo pozdno." 

Deyirəm: "Söz verirsən ki, sabah gələsən bir az söhbət edək?" 

Cavab verir: "Postarayus, no slovo ne dayu." 

Deyirəm: "Xudahafiz!"

Cavab verir: "Do svidaniya!"


<br>

<br>

Axır bir gün dostumdan soruşdum: "Mən ölüm, mənə sözün doğrusunu de görüm, sən ki, otuz səkkiz il müsəlman içində tərbiyə tapıbsan, xəta olmadı ki, bir az rusca oxudun? Nə səbəbə sən mənlə heç müsəlmanca danışmaq istəmirsən?"

Yoldaşım mənə rus dilində belə cavab verdi: "Sluşay, kak-to stıdno, koqda obrazovannıy çelovek po-tatarski qovorit!.. (yəni, obrazovannının müsəlmanca danışmağı eyibdir!)."

"Çox sağ ol, rəfiqim, bunu bilmirdim!..."

## Footnotes

[^1]: Of course, there are some exceptions. Thomas Mann published his _Buddenbrooks_ when he was 25 and received a Nobel prize for that. 

[^2]: This sentence is a reminder to myself. I am more of a Lincoln than Napoleon: my speed of execution is slow.

[^3]: I observe (and probably someone had already observed it before me) that the more complex the language is, the less chance it allows for misinterpretations. Russian language is pedantic and extremely efficient in such matters (летать, улетать, вылетать, прилетать, залетать, слетать, etc).

[^4]: This whole "ambitious" section I should, at some point, translate into Azerbaijani language for it to have any effect. Regarding _Qanun Publishing House_, I know that they have pretty decent translations, and a wrong translation of a single word shouldn't affect my judgment drastically. However, I recently bought for my father the translation of [Meditations](https://www.qanun.az/ozumle-tekbetek-dusunceler-mark-avreli-1241#) by Marcus Aurelius, and while reading, he complained several times how unclear and ugly the sentences were, that he could barely understand the meanings of complicated sentence structures even after several attempts.

[^5]: As of 2023, I am an internationalist. Yet nationalism is needed in relatively weaker and developing countries (e.g. Azerbaijan) as a mean of protection from the dependency on maghtier countries. Nationalism of a powerful country, on the other hand, brings only blood and misery. Furthermore, a nation's survival is dependent on the preservation of language. There are many langauges without nations, but no nation without a language. Except for the United States, of course. JK.

[^6]: **Update (Aug 17):** There are actually not one but multiple resources already. [Achiq Kitab](https://achiqkitab.aztc.gov.az/) is one example. The only issue is that the format of books are in pdf and not html, and the portals are difficult to navigate throught. **Update (Sep 4):** There is also [Wikimənbə](https://az.wikisource.org/wiki/Ana_s%C9%99hif%C9%99).

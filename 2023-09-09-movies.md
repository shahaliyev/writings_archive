The Autodidact (Self-taught man), a character in the book of Jean-Paul Sartre's _Nausea_, has a [system](/posts/concurrency-4). He arrives at the library, takes a book and reads it. And the system is that he chooses his books in alphabetical order.

> I study him with a sort of admiration. What will-power he must have to carry through, slowly,
obstinately, a plan on such a vast scale. One day, seven years ago (he told me he had been a student
for seven years) he came pompously into this reading-room. He scanned the innumerable books which
lined the walls and he must have said, something like Rastignac, "Science! It is up to us." Then he
went and took the first book from the first shelf on the far right; he opened to the first page, with a
feeling of respect and fear mixed with an unshakable decision. [...] He has passed brutally from the study of coleopterae to the quantum theory, from a
work on Tamerlaine to a Catholic pamphlet against Darwinism, he has never been disconcerted for an
instant. [...] And the day is approaching when closing the last book on the last shelf on the far left: he will say
to himself, "Now what?"

This system has an advantage and an issue. Advantage is randomness of choice which can bring the joy of adventure, which can redirect our thoughts and hence our lives to a completely unexpected path. Disadvantage is the unpredictability of quality of reading, as stupidity is often hidden behind wise-sounding words (cough-cough).

Example of randomness. In my post called [What I Consider When Starting My Literary Career](/posts/literary-career) I didn't mention in my reading list Sartre's famous novel noted above. Yet the quote about the Autodidact is taken from that book. Wouldn't I accidentally grab _Nausea_ out of the shelf in my university's library, these lines would have never been written.

If a list is to be defined, then at least it should vary in genre. But even with my poor predefined reading list, which doesn't allow randomness and turns reading into a mechanic work, I can't help but notice something noble in its systematicity. In a similar way, but in a lighter fashion, one may approach watching movies in an organized order as well.

What is great about this approach is that you don't have to spend seven years to reach the letter 'L' just like the Autodidact. As I mentioned in my [lists](/lists/), it takes about five times less time to educate oneself in cinema than in literature. Furthermore, there is already a perfect resource of [Great Movies](https://www.rogerebert.com/great-movies) by Roger Ebert. All a person needs to do, is start watching movies in an orderly fashion, the way it is published in Ebert's website. First he will watch _The Ballad of Narayama_, then _Monsieur Hire_, then _Veronika Voss_, then _Spirit of the Beehive_, then _Mulholland Dr._, and then _The Life of Oharu_. As a consequence, he will reduce the time spent making a choice to zero, will retain a sense of adventure and unpredictability, will train his willpower, and educate himself in a good cinema; he will watch movies that he wouldn't watch in any other case because of the running time, year of production, genre, etc.

The only disadvantage of this approach is that Roger Ebert's list breaks in the year of 2013, upon _the_ critic's demise. The other issue could be with boredom, but one must promise himself beforehand that he is going to watch the movies till the end, preferably in one attempt, without skimming, and without distractions. This is system. And one day, after watching the last of the total of 383 movies in Ebert's list, he will say to himself, "Now what?"

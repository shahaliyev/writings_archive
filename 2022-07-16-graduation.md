I have graduated with my Master's degree in Computer Science and Data Analytics from the [ADA University](https://www.ada.edu.az/) and [The George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/).

I thank all of my educators for their support; I am immensely grateful for your efforts and guidance. I also thank everyone who made this unique program possible, I understand that so much work has been done in the background for us to have the best educational experience.

ADA University has been my second home in the past 6 years, and I hope to return to her beautiful campus in many years to come.

The program was funded within the framework of the “State Program on improving the international competitiveness of the higher education system in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2019-2023”, and by BP and its Co-Venturers.

I won the **Nakhchivan Open 2022** internatonal chess tournament. The competition took place between 8-14 May, in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan. I was 5th in the starting list, immediately after 4 Grandmasters. I scored 8.5 points out of 9 games. Many thanks to [Nakhchivan Chess Federation](http://chess.nax.az/) for organizing the event at the highest level.
